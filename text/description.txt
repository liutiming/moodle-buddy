You are a student and your university uses Moodle as their learning management platform?
You frequently use Moodle to access course material?
You are tired of missing updates and downloading every file one at a time?

This browser plugin will save you a lot of time! It will scan your Moodle course for all available resources (PDF
documents, etc.) and allow you to download them all at once.

Furthermore, Moodle Buddy scans your courses for any updates and shows them to you. You can immediately download new
resources from your Moodle Dashboard via the plugin.
